## CS 622: Advanced Programming Techniques 
`This course starts by describing object oriented concepts including abstraction, encapsulation
and polymorphism in the context of Java programming languages. Next, the focus of the course
will be shifted to the explanation of in-memory Java data structures, especially collections and
efficient disk data storage and file access, including SSTables, LSM Trees, bit level compression,
sliding window, inverted index, hash structures and trees impact on file search.
To enable students to install and configure professional development and programming
environments one or two session will be dedicated to shell scripting and Unix programming
languages. Next, the course delves into build environments and professional settings in a large
scale programming environment. Afterward, different database structures will be explained
and examples with SQL (MySQL) and NOSQL (MongoDB) will be implemented in the class. One
session will be dedicated to concurrency and next students will learn about asynchronous and
synchronous messaging environments, including TCP, Socket, HTTP and Web Services.
Students who attend this course are required to have basic understanding of Java programming
languages.`
