# Memory

## Memory Management
- Java has automatic memory management, it automatically performs garbage collection
- automatically clean things up in your memory

## Memory Structure
- Java divides memory into two parts, stack and heap
- Stack: stores Java Primitive types, and hold a reference to heap objects

## Stack vs Heap
- Stack size is flexible, memory allocation is automatic and has size limits, if stack is full, stack overflow error
- Heap is not managed automatically, we need to allocate memory by code

# Algorithm Complexity
## Big O Notation
- O(1) - constant time
- O(n) - linear time
- O(n log n) - logarithmic time
- O(n^2) - n squared time
